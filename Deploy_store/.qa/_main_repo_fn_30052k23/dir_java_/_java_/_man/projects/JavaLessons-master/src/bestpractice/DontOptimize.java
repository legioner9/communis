//        More computing sins are committed in the name of efficiency (without neces-
//        sarily achieving it) than for any other single reason—including blind stupidity.
//        —William A. Wulf
//        We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: prema-
//        ture optimization is the root of all evil.
//        —Donald E. Knuth
//        We follow two rules in the matter of optimization:
//        Rule 1. Don’t do it.
//        Rule 2 (for experts only). Don’t do it yet—that is, not until you have a
//        perfectly clear and unoptimized solution.
//        —M. A. Jackson
//write good programs rather than fast ones
//measure performance before and after each attempted optimization
